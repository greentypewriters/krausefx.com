# Facts

Once you granted an app access to your camera, an iOS app can

- record you every time it runs in the foreground
- take pictures and videos without telling you
- have full access to both the front and the back camera
- upload the pictures/videos it takes instantly anywhere
- run real-time face recognition to detect facial features/expressions
- Have you ever used a social media app while using the bathroom?

## Disclaimer

This project is a proof of concept and should not be used in production. The goal is to highlight a privacy loophole that can be abused by iOS apps.

## What does `watch.user` demonstrate?

iOS users often granted camera access to an app a while ago (e.g. a messaging app or any news-feed-based app). Those apps can easily track the users face, take pictures, or live stream their front and back camera, without the user's consent.

- Get full access to the front and back camera of an iPhone/iPad any time your app is running (app must be open)
- Use the front and the back camera to know what your user is doing right now and where the user is located based on image data
- Upload random frames of the video stream to your web service, and run a proper face recognition software, which enables you to
  - Find existing photos of the person on the internet
  - Learn how the user looks like and create a 3d model of the user's face (literally)
- With the recent innovation around faster internet connections, faster processors and more efficient video codecs, a user probably won't notice if you live stream their camera onto the internet (e.g. while they sit on the toilet)
- Estimate the mood of the user based on what you show in your app (e.g. news feed of your app)
- Detect if the user is on their phone alone, or watching together with a second person
- Recording stunning video material from bathrooms around the world, using both the front and the back camera, while the user scrolls through your feed
- Using the built-in iOS 11 Vision framework, every developer can very easily parse facial features in real-time like the eyes, mouth, and the face frame

## Proposal

The MacBook has an elegant solution, where a small LED turns on whenever an app accesses the camera.

- Offer a way to grant temporary access to the camera (e.g. to take and share one picture with a friend on a messaging app)
- Show an icon in the status bar that the camera is active, and force the status bar to be visible whenever an app accesses the camera
- Add an LED to the iPhone's camera (both sides) that can't be worked around by sandboxed apps

## About the demo

I didn't submit the demo to the App Store, however you can very easily clone the repo and run it on your own device.

- You first have to take a picture that gets "posted" on a "social network"
  - At this point you already granted full access to both of your cameras every time the app is running
- You browse through a regular news feed that shows you pictures
- After a while you suddenly see pictures of yourself, taken a few seconds ago while you scrolled through the feed
- You realize you've been recorded the whole time, and with it, the app ran a face recognition algorithm to detect facial features.

Chances are, you say:

> Oh, obviously, I never grant camera permission

However, the point is, that if you use a messaging service, like Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram or anything else, chances are high you already granted permission to access both your image library ([detect.location](https://github.com/KrauseFx/detect.location)), and your camera.

### How can I protect myself?

There is not a lot you can, except to revoke camera access for all apps, always use your built-in camera, and use the image picker of each app to select the photo (which will cause you running into a problem I described with [detect.location](https://github.com/krausefx/detect.location)). To avoid this also, the only good way is to use Copy & Paste to paste the screenshot into your messaging application. If an app has no copy & paste support, you'll have to either expose your image library, or your camera. 

For example, [Soroush](https://twitter.com/khanlou) always removes camera access after using apps like Instagram.

Even better is to protect yourself using hardware, there is a lot of accessories available for both smartphones and laptops that solve the problem by covering the camera ([example](https://www.amazon.com/Original-Webcam-Cover-directly-Manufacturer/dp/B01LWS2X8I)).

## FAQs

### How does the demo app get access to the camera?

Once you take and post one picture or video via a social network app, you often grant full access to the camera, any time the camera is running. Meaning, whenever you start the app, the app can use the camera again.
